# BackEnd_Assignment-Note-Taking API
 
Project Title: Note-Taking API

Overview:

This project involves the development of a RESTful API for a simple note-taking application using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database.
The API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations on text notes.

Features:

Create Note: Users can add new notes to the database with a title, content, and timestamps for creation and last modification.
Retrieve Notes: Users can retrieve a list of all notes or a single note by its ID.
Update Note: Users can update the content of an existing note.
Delete Note: Users can delete a note from the database.

Data Validation:

Implemented validation for note creation and updating, ensuring that the title and content fields are provided and of appropriate lengths.

Error Handling:

Developed comprehensive error handling for the API, covering scenarios like invalid input, attempting to access or modify non-existent notes, etc.

Authentication (Optional):

Added a simple authentication mechanism (Basic Auth) to protect the endpoints (optional feature).

Documentation:

Documented the API endpoints in detail, including request methods, URL paths, expected request body format, and response formats.
The API documentation can be found here.

Testing:

Wrote basic tests to ensure that API endpoints are functioning as expected.
All tests pass successfully, ensuring the reliability of the API.

Technologies Used:

Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
Mongoose (MongoDB ODM)
Chai and Mocha for testing

Setup Instructions:

Clone the repository from GitHub Repo Link.
